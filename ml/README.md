ABSTRACT
CollabX is a unified developer collaboration platform that replaces the need for
multiple disconnected tools. It enables users to host or join projects, find
collaborators through skill-based search, and work together in a centralized
workspace. The platform integrates a collaborative whiteboard, shared code
editor, issue tracking, project documentation, and chat rooms, while also offering
on-chain verifiable resumes for transparent contribution proof. CollabX
simplifies teamwork, enhances productivity, and ensures every contribution is
recognized.
